# Rancor 3D Printer

Rancor is a project that came about from being inspired by seeing all the awesome projects at MRRF 2021 and is my first ground-up 3D printer design. It is an IDEX machine with a "spared no expense" and "there's no such thing as too much feature creep" design philosophy. Learning to CNC machine aluminium with my new [MilkCr8 CNC](https://github.com/Makers-On-Tap/milkcr8-cnc) was also a major factor, so if a component *could* be machined out of 1/4" aluminum tooling plate, it was. It was never designed to be manufactured and mainly exists as somethingt to show off.
